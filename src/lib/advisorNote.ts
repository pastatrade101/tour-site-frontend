/**
 * The Advisor's Note, resolved once for every page that shows it.
 *
 * It appeared three different ways: the homepage card driven by the CMS, the
 * same card on the tours listing with its heading and columns hardcoded, and a
 * different layout entirely on a safari-style page reading per-category text.
 * A visitor who saw two of them saw two different companies making two
 * different promises.
 *
 * There is one section now, and this is where its content comes from — the
 * `advisor_note` homepage section, so an editor changes it in one place and
 * every page follows.
 *
 * Only keys the CMS actually fills are returned. Everything else is left off so
 * the component's own defaults apply, rather than being restated here where the
 * two copies would drift.
